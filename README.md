# Multiple-Linear-Regression---OLS-Method
## Insurance Charge Prediction

This machine learning project is all about, implementing a Multilinear Regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method to predict insurance charges. The model relies on identifying relevant independent features such as age, BMI, and smoker status from the dataset.

The OLS method is a widely used technique for estimating the parameters of a linear regression model. It minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed values and the predicted values, providing the best-fitting line that represents the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.

To prepare the data for modeling, categorical data like smoker status is encoded into numerical values using techniques like OneHotEncoding. This allows the model to effectively incorporate these categorical variables into the regression analysis.

After the model is trained, a function is created to predict the insurance charge based on new or test data. This function takes input values for age, BMI, and smoker status and applies the trained model to estimate the insurance charge for the given input.

By leveraging the Multilinear Regression model, encoding categorical data, and utilizing the OLS method, this approach enables predictions of insurance charges based on the provided independent features.
